# Prerequisites
- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=7.4.2&format=all)

## Note about Gradle
If the command `gradle` is mentioned, use your operating system equivalent. (ex. on Windows use `gradlew`)

# Building
1. Setup your Gradle environment by running `gradle`
2. Compile the server into a JAR with `gradle jar` (other build methods work too!)
